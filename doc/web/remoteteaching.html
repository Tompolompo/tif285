   <h3>Livestreaming on zoom</h3>
   <p>All lectures and lab sessions will be livestreamed on Zoom. To prepare for this, please get familiar with how to login to Zoom: <a href="https://chalmers.zoom.us/">https://chalmers.zoom.us/</a> (Links to an external site.). The link to the livestream meeting room is published at the top of this page. The meeting is protected by a password that will be sent separately via a Canvas announcement. In addition, only authenticated users are allowed to join the meeting.</p>

<p>To login, you will need a working CID or GU account. Test if you can login and, if not, obtain a working account.</p>

<p>Recordings of the lectures will not be made available. Neither are you allowed to record the livestreamed lectures yourself in any way. Any such recording is a breach of Chalmers' teaching regulations. The ambition is to create a lecture environment as similar as possible to an on-campus auditorium where we can have dynamic interactions without anyone having to be afraid that this will circulate on the internet or social media.</p>

<p>A few tips for watching the livestream:

<ul>
<li>The livestream will be in HD format; this is best displayed on a computer or TV screen rather than your mobile phone.</li> 
<li>Login in to <a href="https://chalmers.zoom.us/">https://chalmers.zoom.us/</a> (Links to an external site.), go to Settings, and scroll down until you see “Group HD video”. Turn on this setting and choose “Full HD (1080P)”.</li> 
<li>During lectures or demonstrations, pin the teacher's video stream. Zoom gives higher priority to the pinned video, so you will get better quality if you pin this stream.</li> 
<li>We recommend that you connect your computer/TV using a network cable if you can (rather than WiFi which is often more unstable). At home, many of you will have a WiFi router which most often has one or more LAN ports to which you can connect your computer using an RJ45 patch cable (you can buy this in any electronics shop).</li> 
<li>A webcam and microphone are recommended so we can interact during the lecture.</li> 
<li>If you don’t get good-quality video of the blackboard, try to change the following settings in the Zoom client (Settings->Video->Advanced):
	<ul>
	<li>Enable  hardware acceleration for sending video</li> 
	<li>Enable hardware acceleration for receiving video</li>
	</ul>
Try to either enable or disable these two settings. Which one is the best setting depends on the computer you are using. If you have a really good graphics card, enabling hardware acceleration will give you better quality video. But if your graphics card is not as good, it is often better not to have hardware acceleration enabled.</li>
<li>If you happen to have a good hair day, and a non-disturbing background, please consider leaving yor video on during the meeting. The lecturer will much appreciate to get some feeling of having a real audience.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The livestream will start with everyone muted. If you want to ask a question, you will need to unmute yourself. Please mute yourself again after you finished asking your question. One convenient way to do this is by using the “push-to-talk” feature in Zoom: when muted press the space bar and you will be unmuted while you hold the space bar.

<h3><span>Lab sessions</span></h3>
<p>The computer lab sessions will also be livestreamed via zoom (same meeting room as the lectures). The Thursday morning sessions will typically start with a demonstration or feedback discussion led by one of the teaching assistants (see the
    <script>
	document.write('<a href="' + schedule + '">Weekly schedule</a>');
	</script>
	<noscript>
		Weekly schedule
	</noscript>
).</p>

<p>
During the lab sessions you are expected to work on exercises, problem sets and projects and you will have the opportunity to discuss with the supervisors and with your fellow students. Concerning which computer to use, you have three options:
<ul>
<li>Log in remotely to one of the Chalmers STUdat linux computers. See instructions at <a href="https://it.portal.chalmers.se/itportal/Student/Student?setlang=en">
https://it.portal.chalmers.se/itportal/Student/Student?setlang=en</a>. Depending on your platform, scroll down to “How to connect to StuDAT Linux". E.g. from Linux: <A href="https://it.portal.chalmers.se/itportal/NonStuDATLinux/RDP-StuDAT-Ubuntu">
https://it.portal.chalmers.se/itportal/NonStuDATLinux/RDP-StuDAT-Ubuntu</a>.</li>
<li>Use one of the computers in rooms F-T7203, F-T7204, FT4011. These rooms are reserved for us on Thursdays from 8-12, and can be used if available on other times. Note also that these rooms are made available at half capacity, with every other computer reserved for remote access. Please respect the distancing guidelines and do not use those desks as workspace for your personal laptop. </li>
<li>Use your personal computer.</li>
</ul>
In all cases you need to have your own headset (microphone and speakers) for interactions, and you first need to follow the 
    <script>
	document.write('<a href="' + gettingstarted + '">Getting started</a>');
	</script>
	<noscript>
		Getting started
	</noscript>
	instructions.
</p>

<p>We will be using zoom breakout rooms for group work and supervision. Please follow the instructions from the teaching assistants after joining the lab sessions.
